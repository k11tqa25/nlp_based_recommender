Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,2400,Kenza B.,"He touched something really deep, first he ddnt go the usual route of saying its her choice, because at this point we have been saying it for decades and they just dont want to listen. Its just the western world dont realise that they have a culture too, they just assume its reality and the status quo. And that everything else revolves around it and its crazy. Your culture can and does seem weird to outsiders, and thats okay. Just like our culture can and does seem weird to you. But we make the effort of understanding your culture and respecting it. You just go into let's assimilate them to our culture mode."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,1200,Marissa Urias,"Wow, people in the comments really don't get that a lot of women CHOOSE to wear hijabs. Like, yes, there are countries where they're not given a choice (and we can talk about how western imperialism caused it), but from what I've seen, most hijabis choose to wear them the same way I choose to wear heels on a night out."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,139,sonia khan,The patriarchy in the west wants women to look sexy. Patriarchy in the Muslim world keep the women covered by force when in actuality there is no force in Islam. If you really care about women you should consider asking a woman if she is free to wear what she pleases. It pleases me to follow God’s commandments so I wear the Hijab. If a girl wants to wear a short dress that’s her choice no need to slut-shame. Live and let live people.

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,37,Bruklyn A,"Muslim woman here...born into Islam & I proudly wear hijab. No one made/makes me wear it. Many Muslims born in America actually have the opposite issue, especially those who attend college. Literally had to fight my parents (right after 9/11) to wear it in middle school. They were afraid of bullying & rightfully so. The struggle however, made me a stronger and more proud Muslim. I have family overseas whose daughters don't wear hijab until they're teens. Ppl really have no clue of what it means & that MOST Muslim ladies wear completely by choice."

If anyone actually thinks that we have a choice in what we wear in western culture, try being a male partner in a major law firm or a male trader on Wall Street and coming to work in a little black dress and heels.  All cultures are oppressive to some degree.  We choose to be part of a culture and we hold to that culture's rules."

Making it sound like it’s ludicrous that hijabi women are forced to wear the hijab is ludicrous in itself.

Women, on the hand, do ear much comfortable outfits and are not at all bothered to cover every single hair in their heads. I don't understand it either like its so hot outside why would their wear those robes?! The answer is that: culture. Plus, i figured out that the type of cloth used to make those robes is chosen with care and it keeps the body cool and fresh."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,52,Jasmine S,"I come from a Muslim family and no it's not all coming from free choice. And it's also not always by force. All humanity faces the internal pressure to fit in and follow society's ideals norms and moral mapping. I would question how much of people's choices are coming from their own idividuality or from a notion in their head of who they are and what is right or wrong.

 I believe we all have choice at the end of the day but  I wonder how much choice a woman in oppressive or even just conservative environments actually has. I wouldn't say she has completely free choice when some choices are not as safe, accepted, and I would say dangerous at times for example to wear what you want if what you want is not to cover up. 

So in semi conservative environments maybe nobody is forcing her to wear those things directly but she's backed into a corner and it can feel safer and more moral in the corner than out and after a while the corner becomes normal and familiar even to the women themselves."

In many countries it really is forced by law, and if you've ever worn one, you know how uncomfortable it is. Not every woman wants to wear them. I enjoy wearing them in winter when it is cold out, or wearing a niqab in the summer when it's dry out and the sun is blasting on my face. But I don't want to wear them most of the time and it's always sliding off my head and I feel like I look like an egg."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,0,Exotic,"Good and funny answer, it's not easy to compine these two together in an answer.

To make the answer more complete, Muslims pray, wear the hijab, do good deeds, avoiding sins, and etc not just because there's some health beneficials, also because they believe there's a purpose for this life, and not some random purpose, skipping details and jumping to the answer they believe that this life is nothing more than a test, we don't just die then there's nothing

As those whom do good deeds will be rewarded, and those whom do bad stuff will be retributed, as no one can escape from hurting a human being or even animals in any way.

I think that sums the most important reason."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,56,Abdisalam Farah,"Many angry xenophobes in the comment section, just because this guy punctured wholes in their argument - It is true whether you like it or not: ""The world doesn't revolve around your values and how you see the world"". Many who argue that Muslim women shouldn't wear hijab don't have the best interest of women at heart, their opinion is based on hate seeing other cultures living in their city. Mexicans for example don't wear hijab, yet there are many like Trump who hate them simply because they speak Spanish or they have different culture. Racists will always hide their argument in a way that doesn't seem racist, xenophobia or discriminatory: ""Oh... Muslim women are oppressed - I don't like seeing them wearing that towel on their head in my town""."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,0,crazy girl,"I wear a hijab not a scarf a full hijab because I believe in Allah, I trust Allah and when you trust someone you really really trust him, you know he's telling you to do that for your own good
For Muslims like me Allah is the one who made us! And we serve nothing to him we litterly can't Benefit him nore we can harm him, otherwise he can do whatever he wants he could bless us in a millisecond or curse us in another, so really, whether I wear a hijab or not, Allah can't be harmed or blessed, the only one who's gonna get a positive or a negative outcome of whatever I choose to do is ME! only me.
Also a lot of people think it is because women in Islam are considered a shame, they cover themselves up, NO! Do you ever see a unique pearl outside just like that without a cover and protection? No, that's right, that's how Islam considers women to be (now I said the Islam and not the society people! don't mistake these two words ever.) 
Also, in Muslim countries usually we don't find that much of insecurities especially about women's body, and you already guessed why, also I'm not gonna hide the fact that this is increasing because of how far we got from our religion it is truly shameful to see that some Muslims only have the name of Islam they have no faith still they get to speak in medias about something the don't really know nore they understand.
So please don't tell lies about my peaceful sweet religion, and if you do not believe me go read about the prophet Muhammed, read the Quran, you could read about any prophet (but the real story not the lies)
I love you and respect you whatever your religion is, and I would love to expect the same thing from you, not acceptance I don't need it Tbh but I could use some respect, and if you're ignorant about something ask questions, don't make assumptions.
Have a wonderful day everyone"

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,4,M,"I was in Iran six weeks ago. I became friends with two girls down in Shiraz, and went on two dates with a girl up in Tehran (who I'm still in contact with). One of the two girls in Shiraz got a fine for not wearing the hijab in her husband's car. I can't remember what the amount was but it was substantial. 
The girl in Tehran is currently trying to flee the country but she can't leave without her husband's (whom she's trying to divorce, hence me being on the date with her) or father's permission. 
All three girls hate wearing the hijab, and it's very much forced upon them. It's not culture, it's not choice, it's oppression. Khomeini enforced it in the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution. 
Stop. Making. Excuses. For. It. 
It's in no way akin to a woman in the west wearing a short skirt and stilettos because of cultural norms - it is enforced with violence and prison and fines. If you put a hoodie on over your dress you don't get western morality police bundling you into the back of a fucking van. 
This neglect and disregard amongst western liberals for women in certain middle eastern countries is infuriating, and it's all driven by the desire to show how inclusive and open minded we are, when it actually portrays the opposite."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,0,Frank the Ant,"it's kind of sad because people have a preconceived notion that most Muslim women are forced to wear the hijab when that is NOT the case. First of all, most Muslims aren't even practicing, so most don't even wear hijab. Secondly, the vast majority of women are not forced to wear the head-covering. I'm not Muslim, but I've got a Muslim family, and not a single person in my massive family has ever been forced to wear anything. Only a few people in my family wear the hijab and it's of their own volition.
The truth is most Middle Eastern & Southeast Asian men prefer the hijab off these days. They are just as susceptible to western cultural influence than anyone else. Also, the idea that Muslim women are victims is utter nonsense. The amount of control women have in my family is crazy. Everything is done with the permission of women, and I know because I've got 6 sisters. You can't force women to do anything, let alone wear a hijab. That's the reality of the situation.
The other thing I find strange is that people don't seem to critique Nuns the same way because there's a perception of modesty and religiosity, and yet the same cannot be said for Muslim women. The truth is Islam is not very different from Christianity or Judaism. Many of the rulings are from the Old Testament, Torah and Talmud. You will find things like stoning, lashing, etc... In the Bible as well, but nobody seems to know about it. Pork, alcohol, modesty & other stuff is also found in the Biblical narrative, it's just that nobody seems to interpret it in a literal sense."

The woman in the burka looks at her and thinks ""nothing covered but her eyes. What a cruel male-dominated culture"". 😂
I think they are both right tbh. Women are used as objects for men in the world. A Muslim man covers his wife or daughter because she is his ""property"" and doesn't want her to be exposed to anyone. Western world use media and fashion to make women do everything in their power to show as much of their beauty as possible  for people's approval and satisfaction.

I like what Rami is saying, his heart is in the right place on this. Although, the Hijab is slightly tricky to understand anyway perhaps because of the way Islam offers spiritual relief and consequently can reside in people’s brokenness, primitiveness and fearfulness where one can be part of something she doesn’t have to understand. Literally. 

In such a primitive society where you cannot have yourself, it’s very hard to be spiritual but it works out in the end I guess. Islam in its self will not let you get any further spiritually unless you shed some skin. It’s the sincerity of the intention that determines your place with Allah basically. If you want some, understand some 🤣"

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,3,عتيقة,"hijab is the same everywhere. It's not based on the area you live. Hot or cold. Inside or outside. It's kind of worship.





.


People need to understand that. Wearing hijab is form of worship. No matter how you look, where you live, white, yellow, black, you do it.


And if you don't, just means you don't do the worship.


Well we know there are many kind of worships, just do the other. Therefore it's a choice. 


And if somebody refuse to do any of it.

Not wearing hijab
Free sex
Drinking alcohol
Eat pork
Not praying
Not fasting
Not reading Qur'an 


You are not muslim, or you are but less. 


Yet you feel unfair.




It is funny. Why you bothered being called not muslim, or less muslim while you don't feel bothered not doing any worship at all?





People pointing at you calling you less muslim is smaller matter, than God commanding you to worship him. 



Yet you bothered by the people. Ugh. 🙄🙄🙄"

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,2,Zee Jamz,I absolutely HATE it when I see men defending women’s “choice” of wearing the headscarf. I hate men who talk about what women should or shouldn’t wear. The number of women wearing hijab is decreasing because the brainwash effects we had are finally fading. My happiest moment was when I took it off and felt the wind in my hair. And yes it’s a sign of oppression and brainwash.

That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”

Women in the Western world had to fight for hundreds of years to wear short skirts in public, and they are still commonly shamed for it.

It’s true and I’m one for tolerance and multiculturalism. But there is no excuse for Hijab though. Try as I might and I’ve traveled the world over. It’s not about looking at something weird, it’s about a compressed symbol of thousand years of women’s oppression under religious rules. Sorry, Remy.. it’s just not about people being uncomfortable with something strange to their culture. This is something else entirely."

No denying that women should be free to wear what they wish to wear but they way people come in support of women wearing hijab I hardly see the same people coming in support of women who are forced to wear the same(Eg - Saudi Arabia and Iran).
I find people like Ramy Youssef and his supporters hypocrites."

Ramy Youssef: Feelings (2019) | Why Do They Make Her Wear That (Clip) | HBO,2,ruya x,"I like this guy, but this is simply not at all a smart comparison. most women who grow up in religious families (same for christianity and hasidic jewish) with the belief that they are sinful and should cover themselves up. I know that some people will argue that in Quran this is because women are valued and they were told to protect their valuables such as jewellery. Also that it actually applies to men as well. But with all ideologies, people grow up brainwashed in their families. Therefore they can even say they've chosen to wear hijab because that's all they've known, and the only way to be not persecuted in their society.  Most religion is very misunderstood, misapplied and to be perfectly honest, outdated. So if you haven't lived in Middle East don't come and say ""ohh women are perfectly free to choose however they dress, they so so so want to wear a hijab""."

Our relatives are worth as making extra efforts to be punctual or keep promises, more so than doing that for strangers or administors.. It s the minimun amount of respect you owe the poeple close to you.. It s not about being formal or not. She acts like if i m ponctual by accident, when in the contrary, it is a conscious effort. That s why it s the more maddening to have all be in vain. I can't divorce her. :p
Furthermore, i hate the cliché on tardiness being exclusively feminine. Well, i guess it s probably true as women have to much details to fix and they are more self conscious about their appearance and they are the main target of fashion/makeup industry..too much options to chose from and all that..not to mention  the longer hair that takes ages to be washed and lotioned and done..All that, and yet, i can't count the number of times i've been made to wait on male friends..and they do not even apologize about it..worst, it s usually for no particular reason and not for the time they put on making themselves presentable. No, it s because they did not pay attention to the time, or found something on TV to watch or made a sandwitch or a nap or went to some chop on the way or to meet a fellow for dunno..

Amy Schumer - Mostly Sex Stuff - Porn Endings,100,zyxwut321,"Some of her fame is because unlike most celebrities you can actually imagine knowing her in real life. She's an everywoman. Almost every American town, suburb and city of any size has lots of girls who look like something like Amy Schumer. Many of us have gone to high school with someone with a similar persona and personality as her. She's not obese but she's pleasantly chubby in the way a lot of guys like. She was the crazy party girl on the fringes of being popular who was just cute enough to hook up with several of the football and basketball players but quite hot not enough to be homecoming queen. She's the sarcastic bawdy outgoing sorority girl at your local state college and office admin flirt with funny stories who keeps up with the bosses' jokes."

He thinks 'what should I write this time? Should I make fun of the fact that she always makes vagina jokes? But I don't have a vagina so clearly that's not very good material. You know maybe I could bring up the fact that she's hot or something to misdirect everyone's attention. Yea!...' He sits down, cracks his knuckles, then types 'women aren't funny'. Nailed it.

Amy Schumer - Mostly Sex Stuff - Porn Endings,0,whitepride1004,"But she's not funny.  She tries too hard to be funny to be funny.

Amy Schumer - Mostly Sex Stuff - Porn Endings,10,Txrn-Pages,"Only reason why people don't think she's funny is
 because
 it's not socially acceptable for women to be so crude, so until it becomes more accepted people will continue to think she's not funny. I used to think she wasn't funny a while back, but I became a little more open minded now I think she's 
hilarious. "

I'm almost convinced that they don't really like it at all, that the female orgasm is a myth, and that it must just be about free dinner. For girls to watch porn, which is clearly geared towards guys, is just as clearly a concession to guys - and let's not even get started about dumb bitches making out with each other at the bar to get guys to look at them. And if chicks were into sex for sex's sake, the way dudes are, they WOULD love to get jizzed in the face. Trust me, gay dudes love it."

OJ Simpson Doesn't Like Arsenio Hall | Netflix Is A Joke,0,Sundaresh Venugopal,"I am not speaking for or trying to defend O J Simpson,or speaking against him trying to pass judgement on him, although I would always question his judgement and the wisdom behind his chosen course of action, and I do not know him or the kind of person he is, and I would not want to idolize him, or want to be anything like him,but I suspect like so many awarded and acclaimed celebrities in the world of entertainment who are involved in hypocritical, loveless and scandalous marriages, he probably was two-timing and had extramarital affairs and relationships on the side, and he probably was cruel to his wife and I do not know how he regarded women in general, whether he truly respected and revered them or not, but according to the testimony of another woman interviewed in a news programme much later after the incident , a woman who is a journalist or a reporter who was on O J Simpsons case,  who was also entangled with him, although I am still unclear from her story/narrative about who wooed or tried to woo, who courted or tried to court, who baited or tried to bait, and who made advances sexual or not toward whom, and yet by her own admission, she says O J Simpson was still obsessed with his first wife and still saw his first wife in this journalist, which the way I read/see it was probably  because he truly loved his first wife, if he tried so hard to be faithful even to her memory,  which is more than I can say for his first wife itself who probably never loved him at all, who upon scenting/sighting fresh blood seems to have jumped at the first opportunity and had this torrid adulterous affair with this young lad. Exactly whose confidence and whose trust has been betrayed, who has murdered whom, and which commandment of which supposedly just law has been broken here. If you ask me she is not exactly the paragon of virtue, truth and beauty herself. But I still feel this in no way exonerates or absolves O J Simpson of his guilt or excuses his unmanly and cowardly behavior and downright deplorable conduct.  He should have chosen to be the better gentleman and the larger individual and simply let her go, and let her have her will and let her have her say and let her have her way. It is neither good nor just, nor right for one to impose ones will or for one to impose ones way upon another, no matter whether the relationship is based or not based on blood, although I am not speaking for someone or putting it past someone who would rather be a boss and a dictator and a tyrant.   No court of law recognizes if not the validity, certainly not the sanctity of a marriage, where one or both parties are engaged in an adulterous extra-marital relationship, and a breach of trust is a far graver offense than a breach of contract. Candidly the reason I do no like to read much or pay attention to the news too much is because much of what I read and hear and see deeply upsets, worries, disturbs and alarms me and hurts me, makes me question and doubt my faith both in the sovereignty of god and in the splendor of man."

OJ Simpson Doesn't Like Arsenio Hall | Netflix Is A Joke,0,space boy,"O.J didn't kill his ex wife and her bf Ron Goldman. There was no chance he would have stabbed them over 200 times each. People don't realize that Nicole Brown had a friend named Nicole Barbierri . She was a huge cocaine addict. She owed dangerous men tens of thousands of dollars for her cocaine habit. Ron and Nicole were given ""Colombian Neck ties"". You people have no idea about the truth. O.J broke the law to get his shit back years later and everyone says ""See, that means he is guilty of murder"". No. It doesn't. If anything it's proof he is innocent. He was pissed that his whole life was destroyed and his defense team proved he was being framed. The LA police planted evidence inside his home. They entered his house and planted evidence, after they met with him and drew blood from him. They illegally arrived on his property. The Civil lawsuit from the Goldman's ruined O.J and basically took his wealth, this after he was acquitted of murder. Remember the joke about his gloves? People talk about how O.J was barely pulling down on the gloves. The Prosecution says, the blood shrunk the leather gloves. LMAO. Are you fucking kidding me? Leather won't shrink from blood stained gloves. Also, the time frame that was presented from the Prosecution was beyond rational and was not possible. Those small leather gloves belonged to a smaller person. I also believe that there might have been two people there to murder Nicole and Ron. There is no way one person kills both because one would run or scream, that's common sense. Also, it would also imply that the person was waiting for her date to come. O.J was on his way to the airport, but somehow ready to make a pit stop and murder his wife. How the fuck do you plan your flight and when your ex-wife's date shows up. Think about that for a second.


Next, the amount of physical damage to O.J's body was non existent. Do you know that the Prosecution tried to argue that a paper cut size scratch on his hand, but wait he was wearing leather gloves. Also, O.J had stated consistently how he cut his hand. That testimony never changed from the moment he was illegally questioned and detained by the LA Police. You want to talk about motive? Detective Furhman dated Nicole Brown and hated O.J. Now he had a reason to hate O.J because he immediately assumed that Simpson killed her. Then why plant evidence? Because Furhman had nothing and the only way to create a case is to literally make one up. One of the most well known forensic scientists in the world proved that the LA Police Dept planted blood on O.J's socks. Because the blood stain soaked through to the other side of the sock, which means if his foot were in the sock, the stain would not have traveled through his ankle bone to the other side of his foot. The sock was without a foot in it on the floor of O.J's house, where Mark Furhman poured blood onto it. He is a fucking idiot and didn't realize that this can be easily figured out by Forensic Scientists. Everyone asks ""why did O.J run?"". Because he was a wealthy black man who used to hit his wife. How in the fuck does he look innocent?"

He probably just checked the only box that's supposed to say 'yes' to a 'no' on the paperwork - we've all done it. It's just most people don't make up a story to tell on stage because of their own insecurities i.e. not being as good of a comedian as their peers.

Here are the facts:
- Trump 3.2% GDP 
- Trump 3% wage increase
- Trump historic stock market 
- Trump historic
- unemployment for women women in 70 years. 
- Trump Nation’s Lowest unemployment for black and Hispanics in our history 
- Trump Crushed ISIS 6 months after taking office 
- Passed historic tax cuts
- Passed historic criminal Justice reform freeing many people jailed by democrats 
- Created economic zones that brought millions of dollars to start or grow small businesses in minority communities. 
- Record # of Fed Judges 200+ 
- Built 300+ miles of border wall 
- Middle East Peace Deal

Democrats will say that all that Trump’s economy and accomplishments are out the window because of COVID 19. That is a lie. 
The facts are that Trump’s leadership and vision resulted in many wins for all Americans. The slowdown due to COVID 19 and  is artificial and not tied to Trump’s policies that clearly improved the lives of all Americans. 

Trump gets it done! Trump did it without democrats who said what President Trump accomplished could not be done. Trump can do it again regardless of the COVID 19 artificial slowdown. 

Trump 2020 
Winning with facts.

How Bert Kreischer Got His Guns Without The Paperwork | Netflix Is A Joke,2,Butch Lane,"It is fascinating that Americans have such a BIG attraction to guns. Though given the current president, so many others, and the statements they make, the attraction appears to be, like so much else Americans prioritize, a feeling of control or power. Very rarely, if ever, does the need for protection or safety strike as a true priority. 
Most often, the same ones who claim to be ""fighting for their rights,"" also appear to ignore those same rights of others. 
Typical of the American stereotype, they want what they want but it must be how they want it, with little to no thought for others. 
In America, ""thoughts & prayers"" are the BIG reaction following a shooting. In countries like Canada or New Zealand, where shootings are an anomaly, the government actually governs, and gun control means actual control. And, as even small children are taught, if you're not going to play with your toys responsibly and reasonably, they'll be taken away. It's fairly basic. 
After mass shootings, Canada and New Zealand didn't pussyfoot around and hedge on the possibility of maybe doing something. There was no claim to respect a schedule of death, as Republicans claim to follow after. 
In Canada and New Zealand, immediately, within two weeks, after a mass shooting, both countries banned assault-type weapons. It should also be noted, neither country offers politicians or lobbyists huge amounts of cash to maintain or pursue an idea. Gun ownership in Canada is also not the required priority to one's identity, like in the US. Though still very popular, especially in rural parts of the country, somehow Canadian gun owners have figured out a way to prioritize. Compromising is not a term the 

United States looks to understand well. It's all or nothing. 
As Canadians know, gun owners can be law-abiding citizens, and most gun owners understand that assault-weapons serve no beneficial civilian purpose. Assault-style weapons are designed for one purpose and one purpose only — to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time (think LasVegas), no one needs an AR-15 to bring down a deer."

Chris D'Elia - Gay Friend,0,Higher World,"I disagree with the homosexual lifestyle, but I respect their humanity. What I do hate about some homosexuals is that they force you to accept homosexuality either by calling you names like homophobic, anti-gay etc, words that were created to silence you by the crazy leftist and use Government, the very tyrannical Government that they claim is corrupt is a joke they use the government to silence you from your God given rights.  🙅‍♂️  you can’t cry tolerance and be intolerant at the same time that’s hypocrisy. 

The moment that homosexual understand that their is such thing as  diversity of ideas we will see peace, but if they only see things their way they’ll always be conflict. 

Post modernist ruin everything."

You can be black, white, yellow, red, brown, or purple for that matter, you both cry salt and bleed red and when that fellow next to you is keeping you alive it don't matter what color his skin is he's your best friend and you're his. I think the problem with America is people forget that in the end we're all humans with the same emotions, same red blood, and same aspirations, the main one of which is to survive and thrive. I think everybody should be stuck in a foxhole with someone of a different race under fire so they can learn that it doesn't matter what the man looks like he's still a man and when you're both in danger you're both best friends.

It was written back in November of 2014 so please don’t think this a Trump thing.  Also, this ability to be removed from the US comes from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996.  It appears that any non-US person who is seeking citizenship can be removed if they commit a crime.  I don’t think Mr. Lopez is giving the full story nor do we know the full story of each person that has been removed. My point is there are servicemen and women that have been removed after they have served."

As was ""less than half of Latino voters voted in the last election"", and that there aren't many ""eligible"" Latino voters out there.

George Lopez Addresses the Police and ICE | Netflix Is A Joke,1,Jack Secret,"I remember when George Lopez was one of the funniest comedians around.  His bits about Latino culture were hilarious & accurate.  It wasn't mean-spirited and it wasn't infused with political BS to get cheap applause like he is now.   If you're Latino, married to a Latino or live in a city heavily populated with Latinos, you couldn't help but laugh and easily relate to him.  For those of you interested, try and find his first CD called Alien Nation.  It will have you laughing in tears.  His second CD Right Now, Right Now was excellent too.    Today's George Lopez is a sad shadow of what he once was. He's lazy, self-absorbed and polarizing.  Because I enjoyed his humor so much in the past, I always tune in to see if he's turned a corned and gotten back to his roots.  Unfortunately, its just more of the same drivel and low hanging fruit."

If your disappointed by his comedy in some way, please turn to someone who can make you smile. But I've seen this man struggle with the problems in this country, especially immigration. And from a country founded by illegal immigration to a country already populated, we have no right to dare be hurt when a veteran or a hard working member of society comes in illegal because of their INDIVIDUAL circumstances. No one in America is going to Mexico. We have what people crave. Freedom. Opportunity. We can make a difference by doing what we can. As he is doing. Speaking out. AND NO. You cant just say ""OH...

Well....we expect our kids to be better than us but yet parents seemed to fuck it up for the next generation....well lack of parents.

But I liked to look though vegetable seed catalogues for fun as a child, so I knew that carrots can also be purple, red, yellow, and white. So I would consistently give “wrong” answers because my brain struggles to weigh information according to social use. When asked by an adult and I would explain my reasoning, they would get exasperated and say not to show off and to just put the normal answer. But I couldn’t ever seem to figure out what the defaults were. My brain couldn’t say “hmm. We have seen many colours of carrots and have grown purple ones in the veggie patch.

How Hannah Gadsby's High-Functioning Autism Works | Netflix Is A Joke,97,Toxiphilia,"I remember when I was 10, about a year before I got my autism diagnosis, my class were gonna send letters to this kid's show called Hjärnkontoret (=The Brain Office, aka a program about science and stuff). Everyone got to send in their own question so I wanted to know what the lil black part of the pencil was.

Now, to understand this, you need to know this: in Swedish, that good ol' pencil that usually have an eraser in the butt is called a blyertspenna and the bly-part of it means lead. So when we were all reading our questions out loud, everyone started to laugh. The teacher giggled, from what I remember. Some of the boys shouted ""it's made out of lead"" and I felt like the biggest idiot on the planet, shrinking even further into my lil shell. It definitely didn't help me get over my constant fear of giving a wrong answer, so this incredibly shy, quiet child became even more shy and quiet.

Today I know that the lil black part of the pencil is made out of graphite and that it contains no lead. Idk why I wanted to tell this story but I did and thus I did. Have a lovely day."

How Hannah Gadsby's High-Functioning Autism Works | Netflix Is A Joke,302,YuyuLeBrave,"Reminds me of that time when I was 4. I was yelling at the back of the car for reasons history decided to forget. But yelling with dedication nonetheless. My mom, a school teacher, trained in the arts of screaming children, was out of options, and threatened to abandon me next to a field.
 Alas, I was not one for understanding the concept of threats, and knew she wouldn't do that. 
So I kept screaming. 
My tired, out of options, mom wanting to be taken seriously, stopped the car next to a Field.
 I learned later in life, taking care of 4 years old myself, that this is usually the limit of the bluff that works, and the child calms down.
But I didn't do that.
My mother, now committed, took me out of the car, and put me next to the field. No objection from me. Not wanting to back down, she got back in the car and LEFT saying ""I'll come back when you're calm"".
She came back a minute or two later, estimating that I would be taking her seriously enough to be quiet for the last 5 minutes of the car ride. She got out out of the car. I stared at her straight in the face and said ""I'm not calm yet"". 

She put me back in the car and I SCREAMED for the rest of the car ride, the end. 

BONUS : My seven year old sister, contrarely to me, was very impressed at my mom and was crying ""please don't abandon my sister"" and that's why my mom had to come back quicker than she wanted."

How Hannah Gadsby's High-Functioning Autism Works | Netflix Is A Joke,29,Bee Whistler,"This is a mood. I ended up turning a lot of teachers against me through sheer cluelessness. But my daughter came out with one of my favorites.

So the teacher in her 4th grade class read them a story about the 3 little pigs in which, in a twist ending, the third pig ATE THE WOLF. My daughter went up to the desk after and quietly asked her whether in doing so the third pig had therefore eaten his own brothers. Some teachers break more quietly I guess because the teacher just asked her to sit back down.

I think most of us can agree that this was actually a very logical question given the usual pacing of the story and I wonder that the author missed that little hiccup."

 Random stranger: `Cheer up mate,  it might never happen` .

RS:                             `Oh fuck, sorry mate`.
 Even worse for me was when people tried to get me to dance. Sometimes they would even violate my personal space and literally attempt to drag me on to the dance floor.
I don`t dance. Never have, never will. I don`t get it; it`s something that on the few occasions I had a go, I felt clumsy and exposed. I much preferred to just sit and watch people`s behaviour, which I have always found fascinating.
 A bit like being at the zoo, only with no bars between me and the inmates.

Hannah Gadsby Gives A Surprise Lesson On Female Anatomy | Netflix Is A Joke,1,Cucumamacacapipi,"I'm a man and I've had people tell me to smile a handful of times. So I don't think it is just something men say to women, I think it's just something people say occasionally. But it was extremely irritating every time it happened. Because it's someone trying to tell you what to do. AND they are telling you to do something good, so now you have to choose not to smile in order to establish valid autonomy. AND they get annoyed if you respond telling them you will smile when u have a good reason too, so I think women/feminists do have a point that it's probably ppl with subconscious alterior motives who are telling others to smile. Unless you're just saying it in general, to try and be uplifting. Also, I am not a woman but I am extremely short, only about 5 feet tall, and I have a youthful face, so a lot of white people think I'm a minor.  So they may be saying it thinking that they're not talking to an adult man but a teen, who it generally would be more acceptable to mentor randomly in passing."

If there is something wrong going around in the world but there is also some people or any group of people(or organisations)doing great work too. Like for an example , you talked about our prime minister modi in your videos inflencing the people about the harsh reality of hindutva ideology and modiji's workstyle, but you never focussed about the good work which they have done. Like, implementing new education policy which is recently in process of making,which gives students chance to focus on learning efficiently rather than being stuck with report cards,marks etc. In those days when your video came out you never told the people that he was also brave enough to scrap the special status given to J&K  which basically made that state cut out from India and people never realised the true importance of being associated with INDIA,which is sad because in true sense they are a part of INDIA. And as a kashmiri pandits i can assure that,because it is only the Indian govt which supported approx. 5Lakh kashmiri's settle across the other parts of INDIA such as Jammu , Delhi etc. You are only getting famous because you are showing only the true reality of any mishappenings around the world in a funny and enjoyable manner. Please start making videos about the good impact of any act done by numerous people in good fields so that other people could also inspire from that too and not always think that somewhere deep down in any place ,something is always bad happening around the world which is not true. The world is filled with bad people but good people dont get limelight and their work is never being appreciated,it could be individuals, Government steps, companies etc. Your ability to make serious issues made understand to everyone is very appreciable and commendable and it should be used as a tool to give the true reality of everything to everyone in a fun and enjoying tune.

It's not like I am an illiterate woman. I completed my MCA in 2016. I had 81℅ overall. I got prize in my college. But no job.

Sure, that sounds like a good thing until you realize how much more physically weak that makes you compared to the average person. 🙃🙃🙃🙃

On the bright side, all three things aren't that impossible to fix and are currently being worked on.

My parents didn't prepare me for life, they did the equivalent of holding me back several grades.

Especially from the feminist community, it's a total breath of fresh air. Absolute genius!

I don't want to label this wrong, but coming from an avid comedy connoisseur, she is basically neck and neck with Dave Chappelle as far as I'm concerned! One of the best.

... and I'm going to be honest lol I'm kind of a bro-dude, and most female comics don't make me really 'lol'. A few do here and there, but not much. With all gender stuff aside though, this special is by far her personal greatest, and TOTALLY rivals (& even rises above) some of my personal G.O.A.T. comedy special favorites! 

Definitely going to share, and good God; How could she get better from here? Can't wait to see.

Expensive weddings are not only unpractical, they are often so elaborate that the bride and groom don't really get to enjoy the expensive day. If people would only put the effort (or money in the form of counseling) into their marriage that they put into the nuptials then perhaps the divorce rate would be lower.

Then set up the whole wedding which was outside on the campgrounds (everyone who works there is basically considered family) and I was best man and helped him set up the wedding. Then after working for a few hours we went back to his place and got ready. The whole time his Wife was with her friends setting up kinda but we did most of the work. They are both great people though. But yea he worked hard that day, I did too, and his wife seemed a bit nervous but man he was crazy nervous lol."

And this is really the core of her bit. It's really not funny or intelligent, it's narcissism driving an expectation onto the listener. I wonder if anyone has the same perspective.

Iliza Shlesinger's To Do List Before Your Wedding | Netflix Is A Joke,8,Shey's TheName,"BY FAR - The 😂 MOST 😂 Hilarious, Wise, Relateable & Outspoken (etc) comedy special I've seen in a long time (besides Dave Chappelle, LBH)... Especially from the feminist community, it's a total breath of fresh air. Absolute genius!

I don't want to label this wrong, but coming from an avid comedy connoisseur, she is basically neck and neck with Dave Chappelle as far as I'm concerned! One of the best.

... and I'm oing to be honest lol I'm kind of a bro-dude, and most female comics don't make me really 'lol'. A few do here and there, but not much. With all gender stuff aside though, this special is by far her personal greatest, and TOTALLY rivals (& even rises above) some of my personal G.O.A.T. comedy special favorites! 

Definitely going to share, and good God; How could she get better from here? Can't wait to see. 

100% MURDERED Great job!"

Iliza Shlesinger's To Do List Before Your Wedding | Netflix Is A Joke,0,Brit Mcarther,"The reason why I think she is so funny is because females understand her humour, in terms of the way she acts out physically, vocally and imaginatively what is happening and going on in the minds  of females that males find more difficulty in understanding, because to put it plainly , are not females.  And so females,  find it so true, that it’s really just funny because of how ridiculous it is, yet they continue to do it, and they know it’s a silly thing to do at times but it’s what makes them beautiful creatures and deep down females know that. She has this funny way at poking fun at what they do, and most of the comments saying she isn’t a good stand up or she is SEXIST is from males, a tiny majority from females. This is exactly what it is, it can’t be sexist because she isn’t prejudice towards  her sex (or  any sex) She’s just making fun of it, poking a hole in how societies standards is and how females (down to the core of human nature differing from males) know this to be SO true, heck most of the laughs in all her shows are females. She explains it to the people it matters to the most - Females, in such a way where Its seen neither a good thing  or bad . But see the ridiculousness of it all, and it’s funny. Females  understand how ridiculous SOCIETY is in all her jokes surprisingly. Thats true art (Comedy is an art) I find it funny also how the majority of people getting annoyed  by her comedy were by males, even though Iliza is poking fun at women in society. Bit wrong when you think about it, a bit funny when you think about it, isn’t life beautiful, isn’t it funny. 

“We are funny creatures, 
Who do funny things, 
Who handle things in funny ways,
And we don’t know who we get the jokes from”

Jerry Seinfeld Compares Married Men To Game Show Losers | Netflix Is A Joke,1,jav retama,"Gotta say I've never been a big fan of Seinfeld's stand up...the funniest for me are his interviews and conversations with other funny people like in CICGC for his wit and being so articulate with life lessons, advice, or life observations sprinkled in that are not part of his comedy persona.

Having said that...I can clearly see the evolution of his standup and humor in this special. I think this is his funniest  stand up special yet. He talks about his family (he rarely did before)  mixed in with his observational humor. It is also raised up to another level by his physical comedy, expressions, and mimicry...

I can't help, but to see a bit of Tom Papa's humor run off from his family and Sebastian Maniscalco's physicality...these influences just bring out the best in Seinfeld that has not been seen before. 

I highly recommended it...and that is saying something from a ""stand up non-fan""."

Jerry Seinfeld Compares Married Men To Game Show Losers | Netflix Is A Joke,0,v. st. lord,"Nobel Peace Prize...let me be clear to you now Barack obama  --  give the Prize back!

The Nobel Peace Prize your friends (george soros ??) bought for you back in December 2009 mere 11 months after you had been sworn into the office in January of the same 2009 year.
you, barack,  have done absolutely nothing of any value to deserve the honor and legacy of such prestigious Award, and you know it  --  so it is only fair and proper for you to send the Award back to Oslo, Norway -- NOW would be the good time !!!
it belongs to the person who earned it in sweat, tears and fears, imprisoned, lives risked and endangered;  he/she is out there still denied the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 that ended up in your dirty hands.

We all know you did not earn the Nobel Peace Prize, neither did you earn the presidency of USA.  Quite the opposite, barack, you corrupted the integrity and honor of the USA by lying about your place of birth, effectively stealing the presidency from it's rightful holder. 

Then, Barack, you proceeded to corrupt the laws and the Constitution of the USA by spying on the incoming president, attacking his supporters, undermining the new president's efforts to improve the welfare and wellbeing of its Citizens.

P.s.

Jim Jefferies Couldn't Do This Joke in Kansas | Netflix Is A Joke,1,Mark Hammer,"Actually, quail are pretty cool.  I happened upon a mother quail and her brood once, and she did ""the fake broken wing act"".  Fascinating to watch.  The mother hobbles around while the young one quickly run out of the way and hide under a bush.  The mother tempts the predator by hopping around like she's injured, making sure to always lead the predator away from the young ones.  How she does the calculations, I don't know, but she's always careful to never flail around in a way that looks like she's headed to where the babies are.
On the other hand, if restaurants are serving quail eggs, then either some of these mother quail are no bloody good at their job, or else they simply decided that parenthood , or at least having more than 2.5 kids, was simply not for them."

The teacher once took me aside and asked why I would let them do that, since he knew I wasn't the kind of person to cheat.

I told him, ""You've seen my grades in this class. If they want to disqualify themselves from playing, that's on them.""

But if you put a terrier in the same room as that hamster, it has less than ten seconds of life left. They will bite, shake, smack that poor bastard against the ground, and then trot over to you wagging like mad, ready for you to tell them what a good dog they are.

Cats are basically Heisenberg: just some sweet suburbanite on the outside, full of megalomania and sadism on the inside. And they both produce toxic substances that impair human judgement."

Joe Rogan Explains How Men Are Like Cats | Netflix Is A Joke,0,SuburbanHobbyist,"Domestic cats are estimated to kill up to 4 BILLION birds and 22.3 BILLION mammals annually. That equates to around 39 animals that your cat kills each year (unless you don't let them outside) with some estimates as high as 90 on average. Most of the kills happen in housing development type locations vs farms/woods. Because of the widespread ownership of these murder machines, some environmentalists argue policies like trap and kill (vs trap, spay/neuter and release) and restrictions on cat ownership should be implemented."

Kevin Hart - I'm A Grown Little Man - his fear of animals,0,غرير العسل,"توبوا الى الله من الكفر 
الاسلام يبدأ ب اشهد ان لا اله الا الله 
وهي تتألف من ركنين 
الاول لا اله (الكفر بالطاغوت) 
والثاني إلا الله (اثبات الحاكمية والربوبية والتشريع لله عز وجل الهاً واحداً)
قد يقول شخص كل العرب وغير العرب ينتسبون الى الاسلام ويقول لا اله الا الله؟  اين التفريق 
التفريق بين من قال لا اله الا الله وخلع الانداد وكفر بالاصنام والكهنة اعضاء البرلمان والرؤساء والملوك الطواغيت والذين يضعون انفسهم في مكان الاله بتشريعهم قوانين 
فمن كان يعتبر نفسه مواطن فهو مشرك ماعرف الاسلام
ومن اتبع الطواغيت على دينهم سواء ديمقراطية، مدنية، دولة القانون،القانون،البرلمان، العرف، سواليف البادية 
كله طغيان وكلها الهة باطلة. يجب الكفر بها لتحقيق الاسلام ابتداءاً. 
فمن كان يعتقد ان الكفر والشرك هو السجود والركوع ليسوع عليه السلام او لقبور (الأولياء)  فهذا ما عرف الاسلام! 
توبواً الى الله قبل فوات الاوان. 
قال الله تعالى:
((ولقد بعثنا في كل امة رسولاً ان اعبدوا الله واجتنبوا الطاغوت))
وقال تعالى :
((فمن يكفر بالطاغوت ويؤمن بالله فقد استمسك بالعروة الوثقى لا انفصام لها والله سميع عليم))"

Ive been in a police exercise with a police dog set to attack me, same thing. He ripped away my armguard and ran away to bury it in the forest. I dont remember if we even found it. We got the dog back like 10 minutes later, smug like anything can be.

Kevin Hart Seriously Funny - Women,24,Fabo Andolini,"I dont get the haters that say he's not that funny. He just works too hard and he became oversaturated. Most comedy specials are years of hard work, but Kevin did 1 every year for like 5 years or something crazy like that. Nobody can be so funny that ppl cant get sick of them and he was in every movie ever made plus hosting every show and on every talk show with the pressure to be funny ALL THE TIME EVERYWHERE HE GOES....and he always finds ways to be funny in any situation. His older specials are all better cuz he had some time in b/w them so he could really dedicate to his special. Is he in the same league as Pryor, Chappelle, and Eddie? No, but he's an all time great. No man works harder than Kevin Hart, only James Brown went harder 😅😅"

When I was out with my girls or family events, my ex was constantly texting me, asking me “How is it?”, “I wish I was there with you.” “Are you drinking?” “Please don’t get drunk.” “Please be a good girl.”  “How long will you be out?” If I didn’t respond to his texts, he would try to guilt trip me saying “I guess you forgot about me.” or “Fine! Have fun with your friends.” “Please text me or call me when you get home.” “I miss you, I’m sorry if I sound emotional. I just want be around you and make sure you’re safe.” I had to turn my phone off because it was too much. He was the one constantly cheating me, and had a drinking problem. Me, I barely drink and was always faithful and loyal to him. I’m the type of girlfriend that won’t bother you when you’re out with your boys. I give you space because we all need the guys time and girls time. No biggie."
Kevin Hart Seriously Funny - Women,1,melissa saint,"What mars this, for me, is that Kevin Hart is the kind of man who would cheat on his pregnant wife, and who has struggled with DUIs.
There's an obvious reason why his partners crave validation and get anxious when he's out getting drunk without them =/

Kevin Hart Seriously Funny - Women,0,Alice Callihan,"When i was younger, my Mum would pick us up from school (my bro and I) And as soon, as she said, 'work' I knew the next words were going to be about her boss at Hello World Travel.


Vivienne.


And it would always, ALWAYS, be about how Viv thought she wasn't doing enough work, when she had done, double, of what she was expected to blah,bah,blah.


Or about the new girl.


'I'm telling you she has a new fucking hair style, every single day, blah blah, blah,blah. Blah.'


my younger brother and i exchange glances every time like ""What the fuck is it to us?""


She would sit their in the car, or at the bench, the bench for torak's sake, and talk, about how bad her work was, and how her very existence in the socialality of the work place in the facility of travel was virtually non-existent, because her boss was a ""Mother Fucker"".


it got to the point, were i walked up to Mum, looked her in the eye, and said in a low, dangerous tone, 'Mum, shut the fuck up, we don't give a shit.'


two weeks later, Viv breaks ""six laws"" as mother put it, by firing her. 


""And I mean like, what the fuck?""
-Eminem, Rap God


Like, yo, she would ramble on, about how bad, life at work was. 


Every afternoon. And, on the phone.


Then, to our fucking Kelpie pup Brody!


See, now i agree with Kev. Does anything good, ever ahppen, at work, women. 


Jee i haven't been to work ever, but fuck!

But 99.99999% of that violence occurs after a man has been verbally abused and  immasculated, emotionally manipulated, financially milked,  disrespected, and threatened  for years and years until one day, bang. That's unreported violence. Even when a woman is physically violent, it goes unreported most of the time. Not to mention the fucking bias of courts, child custody, alimony, etc. That shit never gets reported, but it is no less ""abuse"", no less cruel, no less ""violent""."

Kevin Hart Seriously Funny - Women,1,Imploding Hex,"Just found this. I am a very literal person so forgive me if I took this alittle to seriously. Why is Hart in this video belittleing women? I feel that even though he seid that he understand women, I think he simply has a personal opinion of the women that he has met. I myself have never met a women who fits the description. I understand Hart has met some difficult females but he seems to take the women he has met and just make it seem like every lady is like that. But I am willing to suspend my feelings for a good laugh all the same. 
P.S I am not a feminist just fyi. I am simply observing the performance Mr Hart gives us"

No wonder Kevin Hart is just hosting some crappy wrestling show now. His original fan base grew up. Still sad cus I used to love his stand up, but whatever. I don't keep up with celebrity gossip, but I do hope he's happy right now, and a better Dad to his kids!

PS- I have no kids. And I'm NOT talking about materialistic shit. We all know that as kids, all we wanted were our parents hanging out with us.

PSS. Look up Dave Chappelle's stand up. I never watched the Chappelle show but his stand up is funny AF and REAL. I've realized this after not seeing Hart's junk for like 5+ years. Dave is funnier and definitely more real than Kevin Hart."

Kevin Hart's House Got Robbed | Netflix Is A Joke,11,xevious2501,"They say success is the root of failure especially for comics, becuase success kills hunger and drive.  Quite understandable, if you consider winning as the end of the race.  After that hard push to be the victor, you begin to power down, slow to a trot and take a breather. you bask in the spoils of victory and loose that flame that enabled you to win in the first place.   Thats how it is for most people and their careers of choice,  But for entertainers, the ones doing it correctly,  they keep themselves from crossing that finish line.  ever moving it away from themselves the more and more they get close to it.  As a result they remain in form, remain sharp, and though seldom ever viewed as the best of the best because they refuse to cross that finish line,  their performance typically far exceeds their competition.   Kevin Hart clearly is not at the level he was years ago.  it is to be expected,  as he's been at the top for a very long time,  but he's crossed that finish line several times.  and every time he's been a bit less and less of what he was in the past.   Now.. at least in this show,  he's become more of a cliche to his own act.  and all that success has stagnated his growth.    Dave Chappelle on the other hand, not only moves that finish line far from him, but he's also deliberately taken himself out the race just so he can get back into training to remake himself,  And unlike kevin, who as been the same exact kevin throughout his comedic career,  Dave has worn many different faces, been several distinctively different sorta of comics, exploring many ways and angles  of comedy to reach that finish line first only to hit the reset button and do it all over again.   Dave is a monster, because his comedy is that of fine wine,  the older he gets, the more his comedy digs intellectually deep.  Kevin hart is a great comedian, but dave chappelle is one of THE GREATS.  And all of the greats pay tribute to one who's comedic and intellectual prowess transcends generations and that lenny bruce.  Our most beloved comedians those who have hit hard have nothing on Lenny Bruce, especially when taking into account his act, and his era.   He was way WAY ahead of his time.  As for K hart..  i think he needs to hit the reset button and take it back to the beginning.  He's forgotten his goal,  not by measure of fame and wealth, but by will to succeed."

Marc Maron Thinks Marvel Movies Are The Next Big Religion | Netflix Is A Joke,0,Ed Smythee,"(2:48) It's weird that he's shitting on the superhero genre when he's clearly familiar with pieces of terminology that are associated with mainstream superhero comics (i.e., ""titles"").

I know that he's had indie/underground comic artists like Peter Bagge and Tony Millionaire on the podcast, but generally speaking, the term ""title"" isn't used in reference to the type of small press or self-published comix that those guys produce. You'd usually use that word to denote an ongoing series involving mainstream characters at a company like Marvel or DC.

Regardless, even though I disagree with Maron on this point, I can respect his opinion and I think the bit is well-executed."

There's only one issue with his set: he always ends the joke by making comparisons, which is annoying. His comparisons are great, but he overuses that tool and doesn't change it. If he can come up with more techniques for his bits to variate in style, he's all set for a Netflix special."

Michelle Wolf: Titanic Explains How White Women Are the Problem | Netflix Is A Joke,154,vkb9013,"Michele Wolff is hands-down one of the most talented comics of our generation if for nothing else than the fact that she delivers some of the most incisive social commentary without being overbearing or belabored about it. On top of that, she clearly has a remarkable conviction and courage few people have, particularly with respect to challenging authority figures, as we saw in 2018. Her WHCD set didn’t shy away for one moment from calling out much of the press‘s complicity and hypocrisy in bemoaning Trumpism while profiting handsomely from the book sales, TV viewership surge, attention-grabbing headlines, etc. that it has afforded them. 

And amen to more of Michelle‘s millennial history."

Michelle Wolf: Titanic Explains How White Women Are the Problem | Netflix Is A Joke,1,Njörun Ránsdóttir,"She really is hilarious, her delivery is great... but. I know, I know, “but”— BUT! Her description of “white women” is very much rich white women, and not at all “most white women” like she says. Most working class white women, Irish immigrants, Polish immigrants, Italian immigrants, and Appalachian mountain women, they all had to work too, either in the fields or in the factory, on top of doing most if not all of the domestic work. These liberals going on about “white women” as if they were all rich need to chill the fuck out. Still, the criticisms Michelle makes still stand for middle class and upper class white women... just not “most white women.” Since we’re talking about the Titanic, let’s not forget the Irish mother singing her children to sleep so they don’t have to be awake while they drown to death because the ship security won’t let them off the ship. THAT is representative of most white women throughout history, not Becky from Bel Air, and we’d do well to remember it."

Michelle Wolf: Titanic Explains How White Women Are the Problem | Netflix Is A Joke,0,T. L. Lancaster,"The story of how the Titanic didn't see the iceberg would be hilarious if so many people hadn't died. There wasn't a single dude whose whole job is to look out for icebergs and other debris. There were two. To do their job, they had a pair of special super-powerful binoculars. These binoculars were also incredibly rare, expensive, and heavy so when not in use they were placed in a locker with s special key. Note the singular. One key. Now, while you might be imagining a funny scenario where on the voyage, the key dropped overboard and the two guys stopped, look at each other, and shrugged. But no, it was worse. One guy decided to stay in England for personal reasons. But both forgot he was the one with the key. It was two weeks before the Titanic realized they didn't have the key."

Now I can accept myself and other people because I expect nothing from them. I need nothing from them because I never got used to having them provide anything in the first place. I don't expect people to be nice, so it's cool when they are and when they're just people, I'm not hung up about it."

Pete Davidson Has Some Interesting Thoughts About Sex | Netflix Is A Joke,3,Phoenix,"The cool thing about this advice is that it's actually what sex therapists recommend. Like, nobody can just know what you're into without you telling them. You have to have conversations, otherwise you're not going to be on the same page with what you both want!

Also, a real-world example: I have sex with girls (update 2020: HAD, cause covid'n stuff), and I definitely would rather be with a girl who bosses me around than one who stays quiet and doesn't talk. 
1. Bossy girls are hot, and 
2. You know what they want you to do! 

If I know what people want me to do, I can do it. Cocky but true. But if they're unclear or they don't tell me, I may as well be building an IKEA desk with instructions only in full Swedish."

But dmn this isn't funny. Respect the woman, you have wife and mother. You don't need to say about that. Gut feelings dude! But don't make it a comedy for everyone in public. Talking about sex in private is not prohibited. But think about what kind of weird and not funny joke u did. All of the comedian please, can you think of your jokes. Yes, you have the sense of humor but don't jump in the boundaries. Where you disrespect people."

Pete still spoke highly of her
But hes human. He has all the right to vent in any way he likes. 
He makes jokes about his father's death. His coping mechanism is stand up comedy. People need to stop bullying him. He has all the right to talk about whatever. I honestly donot get all the unwarranted hate. Family guy is a show that has a lot of dark humor.
It talks about trafficking, prostitution, pedophilia etc.

"""Russians"" |  Russell Peters - Almost Famous",45,D K-sky,"The ""backwards"" sounding Russian has an explanation:
Most of the words in English end with vowels, so the flow of speech is almost uninterrupted, like a song. One word stacks with another like a jigsaw puzzle. It starts abruptly but then they drag the word.
Russian on the other hand has majority of the words ending with consonants, so speaking Russian is like jumping on the river rocks, one by one. (I'm native russian speaker) We drag our words and then end them abruptly.
So it's basically English in reverse."
"""Russians"" |  Russell Peters - Almost Famous",259,rougewillow,"Well, in Russia there are two different naratives for native Russian and Russian cityzent -  native Russian is the one who is called RUSSKY, wile Russian cityzent is called ROSSIANIN. And the reason for this is that like America, Russia is very multicultural, so not all people living IN Russia are actually native Russians. They ARE however Russian cityzents. Some cityzents really imbody the culture of native Russians ( its called being Russian at heart ) Others don't - they speak good russian, but their culture, religion and the way they interact with other people is VERY VERY different to any other native Russians or othere native groups of Russian Federation. This goes particulary for muslims and buddist living on the Easter and Southern side of Russia. 


Its a tricky subject to adres, and many foreigners don't seems to care anyway, so regardless of the backround many Russian cityzents call themselfs Russians ""automaticly"".  But by that they refer to themselfs as ROSSIANE - a proud narative most Russians LOVE using.


I'm sure it feels like too much information, but there is no shorter way to explane it.

Body Shops I Sebastian Maniscalco - Stay Hungry,0,One MercilessMing,"The only accidents I have EVER had (knock on wood) have been when younglings about 1/4 my age have rear-ended me at red lights and stop signs. In spite of heavy advertising NOT to text and drive, they still do it.  I've been whacked like this FIVE times.  Each time the punk ass who hit me was texting.  The worst one of the five times was the kid who was texting on his cell phone with almost half a mile to see me stopped at a stop sign,  and rear-ended me so hard that he drove me through the intersection and half way into the next block.  I called the city police, who turned out to be a family friend of the kid.  I got yelled at by the dipsh*t cop for calling my insurance company AFTER I got hit and AFTER I had called the city police (the kid never called the police).  My insurance agent asked me who was yelling at me.  I told him the cop; he requested to talk to the officer.  The officer refused to speak to my insurance agent, who told me that it didn't matter; the company could get his badge number and name anyway.  I never heard anything more about it, except the kid's insurance had to pay for all the damages to my car, plus the medical exam I had to make sure that my aging body wasn't hurt."

Although it was loud, no dents, just black, very noticeable scratches on our white car. I also told my husband they could be simply “buffed out”.  My husband of 26 years, looked at the car, shook his head, and walked away. We’ll..... it’s been two weeks, no buffing has been done, and my husband Kevin has resorted to his typical passive aggressive ways pretending it’s not there. 🙄"

I just feel her silliness & being loud is what ppl found funny but her jokes are terrible. That's my opinion, I do see ppl on here call others haters because they disagree with your opinion which is childish. Netflix mess up when they overpaid Amy when she's not funny, honestly her co stars is what made her movies go. John Cena & LeBron was more funny then her. Since they overpaid her now they got others trying to sue when they ain't worth what they asking for. They want David C, Kevin Hart, and Chris Rock money when their no where near their level."

Tiffany’s not the only one. There are good stand up comedians who are average or below average actors and vice versa. But folks love going after Tiffany. There’s only one Eddie Murphy. Every other comedian/actor has weaknesses in their craft. Pointing out just one person when there are plenty others like them says more about the critic than it does the person they’re criticizing. I think Tiffany’s biggest hits will be dramas in the future. It’s going to throw people off.

And it was.....weird? Awkward. Not at all fun. Just a lot of odd angles. Afterwards, my gf and I kinda wordlessly agreed: yeah, overrated. Next time, let's just, you know....have sex, like humans. If I never 69 again in my life....that's absolutely fine."

I know it's just comedy but why not laugh about what English ppl did in India, Chinese ppl in Japan or Tibet or Spanish ppl in south America. May be what Israel is still doing in Palestine!!! It's not fair"

Trevor Noah Live at the Apollo,0,J. D. R.,I hate the idea that a lot of black people have that being biracial eliminates the black in you... biracial isn't a race... maybe its hard for some to comprehend being two things at once🙄

Trevor Noah Live at the Apollo,0,Arnav Biswas,"A black James Bond. Another white character blackwashed for no other reason than just to appease a certain section of the audience.
And its interesting how people claim that this move is progressive and amazing. Will these same people react the same way and applaud like they are now when a black character like say Blade gets played by a white actor? Or will they riot and protest and call for boycotts and if possible vandalize public property?
Just a thought."
Trevor Noah Live at the Apollo,1,Jan Van Staden,"Hahahahaha,,, 0:40 ""my father's Swiss"" then 5:12 starts talking about his dad being German... Think this guy has been in the USA too long... doesn't know his geography..."

Trevor Noah Live at the Apollo,1,David Bann,This is not really funny...its just propaganda...  His subject matter is racial so the mostly white audience is TERRIFIED NOT TO LAUGH..  See the audience at 1:05
Trevor Noah Live at the Apollo,1,M.M,People don’t notice because he’s kinda “black” but he’s pretty racist against the Arabian people.

People will get offended not because they can't handle the joke but because of their belief (mentioned earlier). Specially don't do those imitation parts please. And I disagree on the issue that Hindu religion is the friend in between. Because come on, don't tell me Mr. Modi is just joking about Hinduism and Hindu nation. Do you know how many Muslims in India are being addressed as illegal immigrants because they are Muslim (by the way they are living there for few generations). So don't pull out that innocent card because you guys are just as guilty. Again these are just my thoughts. You are just a comedian and I am just a viewer."

Vir Das Lost His Religion But Found God | Losing It | Netflix Is A Joke,1,lion fish,"“For   God so loved   the world,    that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not   perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.  Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.  For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.  But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”

You are funny and talented, but in order to boost your career you are selling out Indians, Hindus and yourself, you are certainly not an expert on Religion and Spirituality so don't pretend to be one, also, I am Vegan because of my religious Hindu beliefs and I don't want animals to suffer unnecessarily for my eating pleasure so don't mock Cows and other animals and don't promote eating Beef, you may be entertaining people in the West and other groups but it's offensive to us Hindus, and stop using the F and MF words, it's offensive to us in the East because we respect others and we respect ourselves, we are a cultured people.  Do yourself a favour and go and work in a slaughterhouse and abattoir for a day or two and see how animals suffer. And please don't mock people's religious beliefs for entertainment purposes, when we pray to a Higher Power then we are sincere and faithful, no amount of Western values will sway of belief systems."

Whitney Cummings - I Love You - Marriage & Sex,2,Ogeid Zepol,"And that is a perfect example on why you NEVER marry a woman, marriage nowdays is a scam and a rip-off for men, you lose everthing the moment she kicks you out.

Whitney Cummings - I Love You - Marriage & Sex,0,Zorba the Greek,"She's not bad but not nearly as good as Sarah Silverman...her delivery seems a bit forced, her hand and facial gestures too contrived...something not quite REAL about her.  She also has a bad habit of laughing at her own jokes in the middle of telling them, and her laughter has kind of an irritating quality to it.  Not very impressed.  Have probably been too spoiled by Louis CK...he's so far ahead of all the other comics, male and female."

Whitney Cummings - I Love You - Marriage & Sex,1,MyYoutube,"I love comedy, but after a few years of live shows and checking out new comics on the web, all female comics talk about sex. At least all the ones I've watched. But hey everyone likes different stuff. I just start to feel almost sexist, which I know I'm not, because I wind up disliking the majority of female comics because the jokes are just ask about guys and sex. I have known some women that were hilarious. I tried to convince an ex to do stand up because get observational humor was so funny. Not just about demeaning our sex, or her sex life,  with predictable material. I love tj Miller, Chris Delia, tom segura, etc. Sure I bet you could find A dick joke in their set sometimes. But but 99% of it. Just my thoughts. "

He did not pay for a single thing in our relationship. One time we went out to a restaurant and he was embarrassed that he wasn't paying, so he legitimately asked me if he could hand the tab back to the waiter as if he paid. I said no way 😂 This is why now, I don’t let the man pay for everything in a relationship. I know how it is."
Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,10,Dangerous One,"I feel that the person asking for the date should pay.

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,105,p0rt3r,"We hate women who have a job, earn their own money, and still expect the guy to pay for drinks or dinner.
And we hate them with a passion, if after going through with that, they act as if all you paid for was their valuable time -- the very time they just spent with you, the time it took them to drink your drink and eat your food. As if you were the one -- and the only one at that -- who enjoyed that time, while you had to pay her to put up with your presence.
Then again, if you go down that road in 2019, it is your own fault and you needed that to happen to you, to get back on track."

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,4,Sir Adrian,"As a man I have to say it's not about the money. The only reason I struggle to make more is to help my family (and upgrade my PC).

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,11,etocadet,"It’s funny I went from being a successful manager of a store to a cashier while I looked for another management opportunity and in that window the amount of tinder dates ditched me because they only saw me as a cashier was unreal. Listen I get it, you want a guy with ambition but they just turned tail when I told them honestly that I wasn’t in a good place at the time. That was a massive eye opener.

Women then wonder why men don’t open up and/or they tell lies about their jobs.  It’s our version of make up. We are visual so you guys apply false visuals. You guys are all about emotions and stories so that’s where we fake it.

Also, men’s potential increases over time (potentially) women’s only goes downhill. So if you’re being picky, pick the right one. I’ve seen several of these girls on my tinder list again."
Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,3,Katie A.,"Every time I go somewhere with my boyfriend, he's so quiet and introverted whereas I have no problem speaking with people that are going to bring me food. They've become my new best friend period.. But like when im conversing with the server, they always bring me the fucking check 😂 it's like just because he doesn't want to talk to you doesn't mean that he doesn't have the money to pay for things. people act like I held him hostage or I'm his sugar mama. I mean thanks for thinking I'm independent and what not ... but they don't even put it in the middle of the table. they stick it in front of me like ""obviously you're the one that runs things . wink    no I'm not.

And on the last year's, I don't remember receiving the ticket from the waiter, but this could be because I'm absent minded and maybe happened anyway but I didn't notice xD"

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,0,Al B,"All that having your own money means is that you will be expected to contribute more to the home financially.  It doesn't change the fact that you will still be required to contribute at home as well... and it doesn't give you permission to take on the male role in the household.  Fact is, you screwed yourselves by screwing men.  Through supply and demand you took jobs away from men and decreased their salaries by flooding the market with cheap, over-educated labor whilst increasing the costs of living by driving up housing, transportation... even child care... costs.  Now you spend all the money you make on a maid, nanny / daycare, food delivery / takeout, higher taxes, higher mortgage and insurance payments, commuting costs etc..  Men are wise to this and have decided to check out... so now you get to ""have it all"" on your own and pay more of your salaries to have a man mow your grass, maintain your car and repair your home when something breaks.

Congratulations?"

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,0,33moneyball,Absolutely...the problem with paying for everything is the massive inequality it creates in what the two people are bringing to the relationship.

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,2,Keith Meehan,"When dealing with women I view everything as a sunk cost they are never asking to borrow no no no thats a gift any time a woman borrows money she is asking for a cash gift because she is never paying you back. The lession is never set he president of ""loaning"" them money and when they become too much of a headache beak up with them I dont care how she looks or what she does in bed just walk they are not going to change their sense of entitlment or illogical thought processes and suddenly act better no matter how logically you explain what they are doing wrong and why it's selfish. Also never ever get married because that's the fastest way I know of to lose your house half of your assets and investments and a pretty big portion of future earnings. If you work at all hard in this life do not just give anything away to some woman because what you guys are having sex your both getting something out of it she gets to have sex with you while you get to have sex with her it's a straight swap so no one is doing anyone a favor its an even transaction."

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,0,wunnell,"I know this is comedy but, like all good comedy, it's funny because it's based on truth, so I'm going to look at that truth.  The difference between a woman having money now and men having money in decades past is back then, a woman simply couldn't have money.  Like she said, the relative equality we have now is really quite a recent thing.  A lot pf people seem to ignore the fact that women have literally been trained for centuries from when they are little girls that they need to strive for a man as much money and power as possible because it was literally the only way a woman could get money and power.  It was men who created and maintained that system for centuries so, if men today have a problem with it, they should take it up with all those men of the past."

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,0,Catalyst - D B,"The fact that she’s bringing to light that women are not as enthusiastic about sex as men are proves yet another double standard out there. 

Plain terms: “Woman are not as crazy about sex as men are. Men want it more which woman can abuse as an advantage” which is quite dark and in the words of feminism “unfair” quite frankly SO for men a counter to this has to be made against this double standard (that women can abuse sex to their advantage because men want it more than they do). 

Since people keep bitching about equality 😉😉😉 Am I right? 😏😉😏😉😂

So, anybody got any ideas? Cause clearly men are throwing themselves at women and making it so easy for women to get sex that women are “sexually spoiled”."

Trust, respect and admiration for each other must be earned and the only way to gain that is by being real and sincere, so be good to each other and everything else will work out naturally and will feel right."

And often in today’s world of “equality” where woman are still under payed, woman are often subjugated to not only sexism in the work place but having to worry about stroking a mans ego enough so he doesn’t feel soooo insecure about his partner making more money then him...the same guy that complains about paying for a movie and popcorn...the same guy who thinks woman owe them something...I know the men in these comments saying these gross things don’t have the mental capabilities to understand the points I’m making...or maybe they are just to sexist to receive any critiques quiestioning the benefits they receive from being born with a penis... discusting.

But deep down know far too well those are shoes they can't, nor do they want to fill. Slowly but surely women are realizing their very existence relys on men. It is hard wired in our DNA as humans. A mans true happiness and fulfillment (sense of purpose) is to provide. A womans true happiness and fulfillment is having children, a family environment and the nesting skills they naturally have.to complete the man and womans union together. Both man and womans part in this is equally important and vital for human existence. But the feminist movement feels it's degrading women which in no way it is. Both man and woman are equally empowered with their own very vital roles in life. Feminism isn't the answer, sadly it's the problem of why men and women are so unhappy now."

Whitney Cummings | I'm Your Girlfriend: Women Paying,0,ctguitarguy,"There is actually data that shows as women's status and earnings rise, there mating options decrease. This is because not only do women's expectations rise with their status and salaries, due to hypergamy (women mate laterally and up) but also due to the fact that once women entered the work force in droves, they drove down wages by at least half, doubling the size of the workforce meant women and men now had to compete with each other, and companies could afford to pay workers less. Now you add in the fact that women make up 2/3rds of college grads, and men make up the majority of the dispossessed, alongside automation destroying jobs, especially male centered work, well.....it's a real shit show, especially for the bottom 80% of men most women are not attracted to.

But with this bit, ""the tone"" is such a clear and  integral part of the observational humor, I can honestly throw my arms up in the air and say I am done.

Black Music Tells You Everything You Need to Know - Roy Wood Jr.,101,Micah Atkins,"See, I prefer comedy that involves a noticeable amount of thought into jokes.  You can't try to convince me that there's an out of control problem with minority groups and their inability to take a good joke, when a natural part of that existence is to be on the receiving end of greater society's bullsh*t . You'd  have to be resilient, as well as uniquely thick skinned, which could reach an inevitable limit. Even if they'd come to that point, ...it's still be inappropriate to suggest that these were cases of oversensitivity by people who've lost the American abilty to take a joke. 

Roy just did a 6 minute set that was specifically touching on a politically divisive topic, yet found a way to be funny for anyone listening. That was intentional. Just a professional being successful at his craft.

We all can remember back in school, how there were a very select number of students, who seemed to have only one talent throughout their entire time in grade schools.  These fools had a knack for getting large groups of students to laugh at one (or two) defenseless classmate. Admittedly, the guy (or girl) has a way of making , otherwise nice kids, giggle even when they're annoyed by the everyday antics of the class clown.  Well, it shouldn't surprise you to know that most comedians will confess to having this gift of gab back in school. Some used it to ward off bullies.

Point is, they should be far past that level of comedy if they are truly meant to be in that profession.  Mny of us are funny motherf*ck*rs who can just look at everyday people and come up with something to crack on.  That's not a gift & like many things in life, we lose the urge to maturity.

Well, there seems to be a powerful push by comedians (and those of the far right) to normalize unfiltered offensiveness to the point of being celebrated.
I'm not that easy, nor should anyone else be......

Just a thought."
